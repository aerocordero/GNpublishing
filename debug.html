<p class="p1">Unit 2 of grade 7 provides a variety of assessments that reflect the three-dimensional nature of the NGSS.</p> <p class="p1">Pre-assessment and formative assessments covered in the unit:</p> <ul><li class="p1">{{n79xNbT90}} - Begins with an entry-level assessment designed to provide you with students’ prior understanding of fossil fuel resources, including how they are formed and whether they are renewable or nonrenewable resources. During the first two lessons, you are instructed on how to use this entry-level assessment to address preconceptions and gather information on students’ prior knowledge of fossil fuel natural resources.</li> <li class="p1">{{5919d7a6268e8}} - You assess summaries that students write after illustrating a story about petroleum formation. You are provided with guidelines for the illustration as well as key terms to be included in the summaries in order to assess how well students <span style="color: #0066b3;"><strong>construct explanations <span style="color: #0066b3;"><strong style="color: #0066b3;">(SEP-6)</strong></span> </strong></span>of the past and current geoscience processes that formed the <span style="color: #d3611c;"><strong>natural resource</strong></span>, petroleum <span style="color: #d3611c;"><strong><span style="color: #d3611c;"><strong style="color: #d3611c;">(ESS3.A)</strong></span></strong></span>.</li> <li class="p1">{{591df81d53944}} - The first concept checkpoint with multiple choice questions that are specifically written to assess student understanding of particular concepts and provide practice with CAST questions.</li> <li class="p1">{{5919f9c5c6729}} and {{591a00b8dfe83}} - You are provided with a rubric/key to assess students’ <span style="color: #0066b3;"><strong>use of models <span style="color: #0066b3;"><strong style="color: #0066b3;">(SEP-2)</strong></span></strong></span> on a smaller <span style="color: #357d47;"><strong>scale <span style="color: #357d47;"><strong style="color: #357d47;">(CCC-3)</strong></span></strong></span> in order to describe the <span style="color: #d3611c;"><strong>structure of hydrocarbons <span style="color: #d3611c;"><strong style="color: #d3611c;">(PS1.A)</strong></span></strong></span>. </li> <li class="p1">{{5942cd59bed46}} - The second concept checkpoint with multiple choice questions that are specifically written to assess student understanding of particular concepts and provide practice with CAST questions.</li></ul><p>Summative assessments covered in the unit:</p> <ul><li class="p1">{{5919e42390669}} - Students participate in mock interviews, as a way to differentiate assessment.
