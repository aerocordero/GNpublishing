<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This unit involves many lessons appealing to a variety of learning
        styles&mdash;kinesthetic, tactile, auditory, visual, logical, solitary, and social and embeds several methods of
        differentiation. Art and design, which research shows helps nontraditional science learners assimilate content,
        is incorporated by challenging students to design an air quality monitor and use it to collect data at
        home.&nbsp;It also helps with viewing examples&nbsp;to create a public service announcement (PSA) synthesizing
        all students&rsquo; knowledge. Hands-on activities will appeal to kinesthetic and all learners in making
        plastics, first with paperclips and then with glue and various other materials. Students think through an
        investigation modeling fractional distillation, first developing a procedure and then testing it. These hands-on
        activities are powerful platforms for introducing academic vocabulary to EL learners and students below grade
        level in science literacy with the context of firsthand observations and analysis.</span></p>\n<p><span
        style="font-weight: 400;">A few strategies to enhance accessibility and equity in this unit are to give daily
        reminders for the collection of data on family transportation between {{5919d40f135eb}} and
        {{5919e42390669}}<em>.</em> Foster youth and students living in poverty may need to modify their data collection
        depending upon their living situation. You can encourage them to collect data about themselves (versus an entire
        family) and even could use a teacher&rsquo;s transportation habits. That will allow them to better develop a
        realistic action plan. Position female, advanced, and gifted learners in positions of leadership such as
        assisting EL learners and students with learning disabilities with synthesis of information from various
        websites, taking the lead on reading the script included in {{5919d40f135eb}}<em>&nbsp;</em>and presenting in
        {{5942cd59bed46}},<em>&nbsp;</em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading additional demonstrations of
        fractional distillation, and aiding in the brainstorming of the PSA creation. </span></p>
