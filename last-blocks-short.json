The goal of this investigation is to examine the value of natural resources produced in a healthy local ecosystem. A fox and rabbit are also shown on the right, as students will use their data collection experience and a fox/rabbit/plant simulation to develop insights into ecosystems. The roadmap illustrates evidence for the effects of resource availability via the trees during different seasons. The section of the visual roadmap on the left (mountains, clouds) relates to the abiotic conditions that determine some resource availability. Also on the left, the multi-colored rabbits on the hillslope represent two populations with different variations that help them survive differently. This roadmap image highlights each theme. As the unit unfolds, students will explore ecosystems and ultimately write a letter of thanks and support to local managers of their ecosystem locations."

If shelter is not available, students should never stay in a vehicle or bus, as a substantial structure is much safer. Flash floods can be equally dangerous, and students should seek higher ground immediately and avoid walking through any flowing water. When lightning strikes, students should seek safe shelter such as inside a sturdy building or a hard-top automobile or school bus with all windows up. They should also move away from any bodies of water and avoid isolated trees or tall objects.

This not only saves resources for the classroom and school but also helps demonstrate to students the value of conservation. When products can no longer be used or repurposed, there should be a plan for disposal that includes the potential for composting, recycling, submission to a hazardous waste collection facility, or as a last resort, submission to landfill. Every local municipality has its own waste collection guidelines, so you should check with them to determine your waste disposal options. Many waste providers have printed documentation and including this in your Green Ninja classroom helps students consider the end-of-life options for the materials they see in your classroom. Although in many cases, tossing things in the trash may seem the easiest choice of action, you can help model behavior that both follows local laws and values the safety and health of our natural world.

They participate in a simulation game to find out the relationships in food webs and ecosystems. This game provides authentic data on population dynamics over time. Students consider how a species can benefit from other species in an ecosystem."

To develop science communication skills, students will prepare for interviews. By combining scientific knowledge with introspection, communication is enhanced. Students evaluate their Ecosystem Notebook content in preparation for the culminating activity of writing a formal letter in support of ecosystem protection. Students draft their letters, receive peer feedback, and then complete the final copy of their letters. A post-assessment and reflection complete the unit."
