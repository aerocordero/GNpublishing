<p>We know that learning science without a textbook is different. In our approach, students make sense of the world through a variety of different methods including hands-on investigations, design challenges, scientific reading, online simulations, and the development of models. Below we describe the structure behind every unit and the components to support both teachers and students.<br/></p>
<p>The online teacher portal includes everything a teacher would need to plan for and implement an NGSS unit of instruction. This includes access to a detailed lesson plan and all student facing materials such as readings, assessments, lab instructions and worksheets. These materials can be printed or shared with students electronically. Material kits support hands on student learning, while teacher professional development is integrated into the lesson plans and also offered externally.<br/></p>
<p>Students are presented with a unit challenge that serves as the driving problem during the entire unit. Students will then experience multiple phenomenon-based lessons, investigations and hands on activities as they construct knowledge about the science and engineering topics that are related to the unit challenge. At the end of the unit, students use what they have learned in their culminating experience to solve the unit challenge.<br/></p>
