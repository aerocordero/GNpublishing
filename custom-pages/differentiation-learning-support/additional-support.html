<p>The instructional strategies discussed above create an ideal learning climate, and they also provide the means to engage all types of learners. While it may not be possible to actually know the intelligences and learning profiles of all students, the differentiated approach used by Green Ninja ensures that all students have access to learning. We know that having a classroom full of diverse learners is challenging, even with this variety of teaching strategies, so we offer additional support for teachers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access and Equity</strong> sections in the lessons contain tips for teachers, with suggestions specific to the particular lesson/activity on how to support students with different learning modalities and styles.</li>
<li><strong>Documents in Spanish:</strong> The files and vocabulary terms in each lesson are available in Spanish, providing additional support for English Language learners.</li>
<li><strong>Student Notebooks:</strong> Students develop their own notebooks to organize observations, analyze data, and communicate their thinking. Keeping a science notebook integrates literacy into the curriculum as students develop writing skills and process their thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Culminating Experiences:</strong> Open-ended culminating experiences in every unit provide challenges and opportunities for even very advanced learners to thrive and excel.</li>
<li><strong>End-of-Unit Study Guides</strong> are available for each unit in print and digital format.</li>
