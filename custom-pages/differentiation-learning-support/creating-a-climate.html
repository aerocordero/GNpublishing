<p>The differentiated instruction strategies utilized in the Green Ninja curriculum promotes a lively classroom environment through activities, discussions and the sharing of student work. We look at this classroom climate as a large system composed of natural learning subsystems.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emotional Learning System:</strong> Green Ninja lessons strive to provide multiple ways for students to express themselves—from writing, to role-playing, to creating animations and videos—meeting the needs of the Emotional Learning System.</li>
<li><strong>Social Learning System:</strong> The needs of this learning system are met as students work in teams to understand concepts and develop solutions to challenges. Additionally, there are numerous opportunities for scientific discussion and debate.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Learning System:</strong> Active problem solving is a key component in Green Ninja lessons. Students regularly participate in active, tactile, and kinesthetic learning experiences to meet the needs of the Physical Learning System.</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Learning System:</strong> This is where students learn new knowledge and skills. Learning is facilitated through accessing prior knowledge and engaging the senses. The Cognitive Learning System is closely connected to the previously mentioned learning systems; learning will not take place if the emotional, social, and physical needs are not met.</li>
<li><strong>Reflective Learning System:</strong> Green Ninja lessons include thinking strategies as well as metacognition, meeting the needs of the Reflective Learning System and giving students the opportunity to analyze situations, make plans, and work toward goals and/or solutions.</li>
